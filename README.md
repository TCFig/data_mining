# Data Mining Projects

This repository contains my data mining projects. Each project is organized in its own folder with relevant scripts, data files, and instructions. Currently, the repository includes:

## Projects
### 1. Metacyc Pathway Taxonomic Range Scraper
- **Description:** A Python script that logs into the Metacyc website, retrieves the expected taxonomic range for a list of pathway IDs, and saves the results to a file.

- **Tools:** Python, Helium (for browser automation).

- **Usage:** The script requires a username and password for Metacyc, an input file containing pathway IDs, and an output file for storing results.

- **Folder:** `Metacyc_data_mining`

See the `README.md` in the `Metacyc_data_mining` folder for more details on how it operates.

## Future Projects
This repository will serve as a collection of data mining projects developed over time. Each project will be added in a new folder with instructions and descriptions for replication and use.
